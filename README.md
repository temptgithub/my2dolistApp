# my2dolistApp <br>
This App will allow you to make a "todo" list.<br>
(This App enables you to create and manage a todo list that will be stored in a database cluster in the cloud)<br>
This project was done using - Node.js, Javascript, Express , jQuery, Html, CSS, Mongoose, mongoDB cluster in cloud<br>
<br>
The App allows the user to do basic CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete within a database cluster <br>
and demonstrates basic database functionality for data creation, update, and maintenance over a distributed/"cloud" platform.<br>
To run: you need to install node (you can download or use its CDN), install express.js, & <br>
also install mongoose to utillize the mongoDB (in this case: MongoDB Atlas for cloud applications).<br>
Keep file structure the same so the server (app.js) environment is separate from the  <br>
"client" (index.html & editnote.html) within the client folder for easier maintenance and upkeep.
